**Today's Progress**: Starting with the 100-days-of-code challenge. Today I worked on my EMAG_Price_Tracker project. I practice with Selenium Web Driver - web scrapping information. Manage to get to the telefoane category and to filter by seller(emag).

**Thoughts:** I am in my learning point in working with Selenium Web Driver. I struggle with Xpath and findings elements. I will need also to watch maybe the tutorials from tech with tim about selenium web driver. Still a lot to learn. What is good is that I focus on a project, I am out of tutorials.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
